# How to Contribute

- Please follow the [Swift style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) 
- The `master` branch is considered production-ready.
- Do not commit to `master` directly.
- Do not merge a branch into `master` if tests do not pass.
- Make a branch off of `master` to fix a bug or add a feature.
    - To get feedback on your work before the branch is complete, make a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/chaserx/streakerbar/compare) and put "[WIP]" for "work in progress" or "[RFC]" for "request for comments" in the name.
    - Once you are satisfied with your branch, make a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/chaserx/streakerbar/compare) against `master`. Solicit feedback from others or assign someone to your Pull Request to get them to review it.
- A Pull Request should not be merged until it has been reviewed and has passing tests.
  - Comment "+1" on a Pull Request if you think it is good enough and production ready.
  - Comment on the Pull Request or specific lines of it, but *not* specific commits. Specific commits and their comments will disappear from the Pull Request view of Github if the branch gets rebased.
